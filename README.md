# Prediction-of-Polarized-Tweets
## Introduction.

In order to grasp the attention of huge public, amalgamating polarized content in tweets
by respective news channel has become a quotidian.<br />
With this propensity of news media, there has been thousands of tweets circulating
every day which are leaned in either of the 3 types: left,right and center depending 
upon the leaning of their respective media channel.<br />
The fact that there are enormous number of tweets generating per day raises a very much 
challenging task of knowing how much polarized tweets can be 
generated in next day or next few days.<br />
***This project aims to deal with this challenge by implementing 4 of the timeseries 
forecasting methods of Machine learning which predicts the behavioir of any quantity in
next day or next few days by taking previous days behaviour.***<br />
